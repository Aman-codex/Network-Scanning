# 🔐 Cyber Security Internship - Task 1

## 📌 Task Title: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

## 🎯 Objective
Perform basic **network reconnaissance** by scanning your local network to identify open ports and understand potential service exposures using **Nmap**.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html) – for scanning the network.
- Windows CMD or Terminal for running commands.

📡 Scanning Details

## ✅ Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Installed Nmap** from the official website.
2. **Identified my local IP range** using: ipconfig


Findings

From the scan, several devices were detected with open ports. Some common services found:

Port 135: RPC

Port 139:  NetBIOS

Port 445: SMB

Port 903: VMRC


What I Learned?

How to use Nmap effectively for network reconnaissance.

How to interpret open ports and identify service types.

The importance of securing unused ports.

How Wireshark can visualize traffic during scanning.
